## üöß Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex State Management
**Problem**: Managing multiple interconnected states (cart, products, user preferences) across different screens.

**Solution**: Implemented GetX for reactive state management with proper dependency injection, ensuring efficient state updates and memory management.

### Challenge 2: Image Loading Performance
**Problem**: Slow image loading affecting user experience, especially on slower networks.

**Solution**: Integrated `cached_network_image` with custom loading states and error handling, implementing progressive image loading and intelligent caching strategies.

### Challenge 3: Responsive Design Across Devices
**Problem**: Ensuring consistent visual appearance across various screen sizes and pixel densities.

**Solution**: Developed adaptive layout system using MediaQuery and flexible widgets, with extensive testing on multiple device configurations.

### Challenge 4: Complex Product Card Layouts
**Problem**: Displaying comprehensive product information in limited card space while maintaining visual appeal.

**Solution**: Created hierarchical information architecture with strategic use of badges, typography, and spacing to maximize information density without cluttering.

### Challenge 5: Smooth Animations and Transitions
**Problem**: Implementing fluid animations without impacting app performance.

**Solution**: Utilized Flutter's animation framework with proper lifecycle management and hardware acceleration optimization.
